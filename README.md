## Getting Started
Prerequisites
This project is designed to run in a modern browser environment that supports ES6 modules and importmap. 
A local web server is recommended for development to handle module resolution correctly.
Environment Variables
The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. This key must be available as an environment variable named API_KEY.
code
Code
API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
In the intended runtime environment, this variable is expected to be securely injected. For local development, 
you may need to use a tool that can serve files while making environment variables available to the browser context.
Running the Application
Clone the repository (if applicable):
code
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/arkcom-ai-browser.git
cd arkcom-ai-browser
Serve the project directory:
You can use any simple local web server. A popular choice is serve.
code
Bash
## Install serve globally if you haven't already
npm install -g serve

## Run the server from the project's root directory
serve .
Open in your browser:
Navigate to the local address provided by the server (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
